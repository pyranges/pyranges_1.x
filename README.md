# pyranges

## Introduction

Pyranges is a Python library with a Rust backend for efficient and intuitive manipulation of genomics data,
particularly genomic intervals (like genes, genomic features, or reads).
The library is optimized for fast querying and manipulation of genomic annotations.
It enables intuitive and highly efficient pipelines for genomic analysis.

*"Finally ... This was what Python badly needed for years."* - Heng Li

## Version 1.x
This is version 1.x of pyranges. It is a complete rewrite of the original pyranges library, 
that will replace the "default" (version 0) at the end in 2025. If you are a v0 user, check the migration guide 
in the documentation.

## Supporting pyranges

  - most importantly, cite pyranges if you use it. It is the main metric funding sources care about.
  - use pyranges in Stack Overflow/biostars questions and answers
  - star the repo (possibly important for github visibility and as a proxy for project popularity)

## Asking for help
